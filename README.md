PiHole-ePaper-Display
--------------------

Hi there, This is a Pihole with an e-paper status display.
It is a raspberry pi, running a program, acting as an ad-blocker with a display.

It could run without a display but..
it is neat to see the statistics of the pi hole itself in an easy way. to check how effective it is.
And .. Well, I love to make small electronic projects and code. as one of my many hobbies.

For the build I settled for a Raspberry pi 3B - which I already had.
The display is a  PaPiRus HAT, from “Pi Supply”
And they even have a PaPiRus Enclosure to put it all in.
the perfect parts to my project.

What is PaPiRus?
The PaPiRus was originally launched on Kickstarter, and is now available to purchase on various online stores. 
The one I got has the largest e-paper screen and 4 tactile buttons on the top. The case has cutouts for the buttons and 4 small plastic things to put in the holes. All in all, a complete assembly.
